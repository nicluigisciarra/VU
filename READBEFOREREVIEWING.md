There are 2 files which consist of the original code I worked on and 1 file which combines the 2 with some
changes to allow compatibility and full functionality.

LOGIN_ICTPRG435_2.py will only run the program to create and login to an account, acting as the login portal
MAIN_ICTPRG435_2.py will only run as the main Password Manager if you wish to utilize this one
MAIN_WITH_LOGIN_PORTAL_ICTPRG435.py will run as the whole program which I made it function in a way
which you can only access the userdata if you login to the account consisting of that userdata,
if you login to a new account it will access that unique data.
if you create a new account it will notice that there is no file assigned and request to add the first account
therefore creating a userfile for that account.

There will be 1 Main text file called AccountData.txt which is created after creating your first account
and will assign all userdata in this text file which will be used for the login. After this, each account
that consists of data will have its own text file. There are ofcourse ways to optimize this as if it were an
actual program it would definitely overflow the folder with text files. On top of that I wish to add encryption 
to the files but have not studied that yet and will focus on it after I submit task 1.

MAIN_WITH_LOGIN_PORTAL_ICTPRG435.py will be the program I wish to have reviewed as not only is it my first
actual program I have made other than little play arounds in Excercism, but one I am actually proud of the work.
